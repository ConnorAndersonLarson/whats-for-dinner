##Abstract  
Create a website based on comp image whose primary function is the return of a random dish or three course meal. Comp image and proper colors were provided. Final product has the ability to complete previously listed primary functions as well as the option for users to add their own meals to the three meal categories present.  

###Current Issues  
Text sizing on mobile devices is smaller than I like. Buttons have no animation on hover or when pressed. Currently no options to add entirely new food groups (breakfast, lunch, etc.)

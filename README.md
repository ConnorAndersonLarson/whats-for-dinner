## Abstract  
Create a website based on comp image whose primary function is the return of a random dish or three course meal. [Comp image](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/dinner/dinner_0.png) and proper colors were provided. Final product has the ability to complete previously listed primary functions as well as the option for users to add their own meals to the three meal categories present. [Current site iteration can be found here](https://connorandersonlarson.github.io/whats-for-dinner/).  

## Project Details
[Project specifications can be found here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html). The 'CYOA' assignments actively worked on and implemented are 'Entire Meal Functionality', 'Error Handling and Clear Button', and 'User Can Add a Recipe'. The branch 'feature/button_upgrade' has functional button transitions on hover, changing the color of respective buttons based on the color scheme of each button. This was not implemented in the 'main' branch yet as it veers too close to the 'Intermediate CSS' addition and we were asked not to half-complete these iterations.

### Current Issues   
Text sizing on mobile devices is smaller than I like. Buttons have no animation when pressed, hover animation is created but not implemented on main. Currently no options to add entirely new food groups (breakfast, lunch, etc.).
